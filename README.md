Installation
============
To start MockServer simply execute the `start_mockserver.sh` script.  This will run MockServer on port 8181, at which point you can follow the directions below to load expectations.

Loading Expectations
====================
For this part you'll need to install the node project under the `loader` directory. I'm assuming you

```bash
cd loader
yarn install
yarn run load
```
